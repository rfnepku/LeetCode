Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.





// time exceed
class Solution {
public:
    void addNode(TreeNode* root, int& count){
        if(root->left != NULL) addNode(root->left, count);
        if(root != NULL) count++;
        if(root->right != NULL) addNode(root->right, count);
        return;
    }
    
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        int count = 0;
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        addNode(root, count);
        return count;
    }
};
